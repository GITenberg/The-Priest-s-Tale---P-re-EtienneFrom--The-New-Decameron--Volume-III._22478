    <p>
      PÈRE ETIENNE came aboard at Dares-Salaam and did not at once make friends.
      It was our own fault, however. He neither obtruded nor effaced himself,
      but rather went quietly on his own way with that recollection which the
      clerical system of the Catholic Church encourages. We few first-class
      passengers had already settled down into the usual regularities of
      shipboard life, from the morning constitutional in pyjamas on the boat
      deck, to the Bridge four after dinner in the smoke-room, and, besides, it
      was plain that Père Etienne was not likely to have much in common with any
      of us. So we were polite at a distance, like Englishmen everywhere. Even
      I, who, by virtue of my cloth, might have been supposed to make advances,
      was shy of beginning. I was young in those days, and for one thing spelt
      Rome always with a big capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from the first there was something which attracted me to the priest,
      the more so as it was hard to define. In his appearance there was nothing
      to suggest interest. His age was round about fifty; his hair brown, though
      in his beard a white hair or two was to be observed. In his short black
      coat and trousers he looked neither mediaeval nor a traveller, and his
      luggage was neither romantically minute nor interestingly large. He was
      booked from Dar-es-Salaam to Bombay, and the purser professed neither to
      know whence he came nor whither he went beyond those two fixed points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I was attracted. I have no wish to bore you, so that I shall not dwell
      upon the point, but in my opinion it was interesting. There are some
      people who carry an atmosphere with them as they go their own individual
      way about the world, and there are others who can instantly perceive it. I
      am not speaking of clairvoyance; I dislike that jargon; but I do know that
      I was conscious of Père Etienne if he did but pass the smoke-room door
      when I was about to play a doubled four in No Trumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, our old British India tramp lay about for a week in Dar-es-Salaam
      harbour, rolled up to Tanga, and finally crossed over to Zanzibar, without
      further developments. There we passengers went sweltering about the narrow
      streets, visited duly the coconut and clove plantations, and conceived
      ourselves to be exploring by hiring a car, crossing the island to Chuaka,
      and spending a day up the creek. Père Etienne went at once to the Catholic
      Mission and remained there. Thus it was not until the evening on which we
      sailed that we saw him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half an hour or so before sunset, and a serene beauty lay over land
      and sea. There was the gentlest breeze, and at our moorings it was almost
      cool. We were clustering on the landward side of the ship, smoking and
      watching the town and harbour. Close up under the tall white houses the
      blue sea broke in tiny creamy ripples on the sand or the low coral rocks,
      and, with its green woods to right and left, the city seemed to dream in
      the sun. One could see, however, that it was preparing to wake. A flutter
      of orange or scarlet on the flat roofs here and there told that the women
      were already coming up to enjoy the cooler hours; and between the thin
      cassuarinas in the square that opened to the sea before the Sultan&rsquo;s
      Palace, a white-robed crowd was gathering for the faint excitement of the
      sunset gun. Between ship and shore, the brown-timbered rough-hewn native
      boats came and went on their long oars, and in smarter skiffs the silk and
      curio merchants were taking a lingering leave of us. From the south a
      dozen peaceful lateen-sailed dhows beat up for the native anchorage behind
      which, from our view-point, the twin spires of the Catholic cathedral
      stood out against an opal sky. Despite travellers&rsquo; tales, there is only
      one mosque with a minaret in Zanzibar, and that so small and hidden that
      it is scarcely visible from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching the dhows and sighting the cathedral, suggested, I suppose, Père
      Etienne. Someone asked if his reverence had come aboard, but no one knew.
      Lazily turning the question and answer over in my mind, I became aware
      that I was sure he had. The persistent intuition grew on me. Without
      speaking of it, I determined, out of sheer curiosity, to go and see. I
      detached myself from the group unobtrusively, and strolled off round the
      deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough on the seaward side I saw him. He was sitting in a deck-chair
      and looking out across the water. At first I thought he was gazing
      intently at nothing, but as I too looked, I made out, across the strait,
      the dim outline of the Sham-balla Mountains on the mainland that are
      sometimes visible for a little at sunset and dawn. The priest&rsquo;s chair was
      drawn close to the bulwark, and almost before I knew what I was doing, I
      was leaning against it in an attitude which allowed me, too, to see those
      distant peaks and at the same time to converse easily, if it should be
      permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, father,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we were wondering if you had come aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me, smiling. &ldquo;I believe I was one of the first,&rdquo; he replied,
      in his excellent English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saying good-bye to Africa?&rdquo; I queried, half jocularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I expect so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his voice suggested far more than the words themselves
      expressed. It aroused my curiosity. &ldquo;For long?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall see those peaks again. I saw them first
      twenty-seven years ago, a young priest on his first mission, and I have
      not seen them from the sea since. Now I have been ordered to India to my
      second mission, and it is not very likely that I shall be moved again. It
      is still less likely that I shall return. After so long an acquaintance,
      it is natural that I should want to say good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think I was slightly incredulous. &ldquo;Do you mean you have been over
      twenty-seven years up there without leave?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-seven next month, there and beyond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have told you that I was young in those days, and I did not then know of
      the heroic sacrifices of Catholic missionaries. Moreover, I too was taking
      a first leave&mdash;after two years&rsquo; service, according to our plan. And I
      was eagerly looking forward to a visit to my married sister in India, and
      a journey home after that. Stupidly enough, it took me a few seconds to
      swallow those twenty-seven years; but for all that my mind worked quickly.
      Twenty-seven years of tinned food, mosquitoes, heat, natives, and
      packing-case furniture! That was how I read it. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said at last, &ldquo;I
      should think you were glad to go anywhere after all that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. No, that&rsquo;s wrong; I do know. I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like Africa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman showed himself in the half-humorous shrug of the shoulders,
      but the missionary spoke. &ldquo;It has become my home, and its people my
      people,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned the saying over in my mind before I spoke again. Then interest
      and attraction overcame my hesitation, and I abandoned all pretence of
      making a chance conversation. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I expect you have
      travelled a good deal up there and seen many things. Tell me a little
      about it all. I&rsquo;ve seen enough to be very interested in your experiences.
      May I pull up a chair and may we talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His brown eyes twinkled, &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;especially if you will
      give me a fill of that English tobacco you&rsquo;re smoking. Years ago I learned
      to smoke English tobacco, but it hasn&rsquo;t too often come my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I threw him my pouch with a laugh and went to find a chair. That was the
      beginning of many conversations, but none of his stories interested me
      more than the one he told me that night. He had half hinted of strange
      happenings away back there in remote districts, as well as of more
      commonplace although sufficiently interesting journeys and adventures, and
      it was to the less usual that I was drawn that evening. There was that
      about Père Etienne which made one feel that the commonplace world was of
      secondary importance, and that he, like the poet at Charing Cross, might
      find Jacob&rsquo;s ladder reaching heavenward in any place. Thus, while the
      light died swiftly out of the sky and the stars shone out over that
      far-off range which runs up to the Para Mountains and giant Kilimanjaro
      and that far-flung plain which lies embraced beyond, between them and the
      great lakes, I put my question and he answered it. &ldquo;Tell me the queerest
      of all the queer things you have seen, father,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Unusual, I mean. Not necessarily supernatural, and not
      horrible. But the thing, perhaps, that more than all else draws your mind
      back to Africa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask a big thing,&rdquo; he said, smiling friendlily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I believe you can answer it,&rdquo; said I, impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded more gravely. &ldquo;I believe I can,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell you a little story that seems to me singularly arresting and
      tender. True, I believe that it may arrest me because it occurred in a
      village&mdash;or perhaps I should say a town&mdash;which I have visited
      but once though I have often tried to get back to it again. Now I shall
      never go. Very likely it is for that reason, then, that it lingers in my
      memory as a place of great beauty, though in my opinion there are other
      causes. However, let me begin by describing it to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the slopes of Kilimanjaro you can look westwards to Mweru, a still
      active volcano little known and rarely visited, and from Mweru a chain of
      heights runs west once more till they end abruptly almost in a precipice
      that descends to the plain. At its foot rises a small river, bubbling up
      from half a dozen springs in a slight depression, and flowing swiftly off,
      very clear and cool, towards the great lake which is visible on the
      horizon from the mountain behind. Just below the pool of the source, on
      the right bank, shaded with trees, ringed with giant aloes and set in
      fields of millet and maize, stands a somewhat remarkable native town.
      There is stone in the hills, and the natives have drawn and worked it for
      their huts&mdash;not a usual thing in tropical Africa. They may, of
      course, have learned the lore themselves, or some wandering Arab traders
      may have taught them; but I have another idea, as you shall hear. Be that
      as it may, there the neat houses stand&mdash;grey walls, brown thatch,
      small swept yards of trodden earth before them within the rings of neat
      reed fencing. Great willows grow along the bank and trail their hanging
      tendrils in the water, and the brown kiddies swing from them and go
      splashing into the stream with shouts of delight. The place is remote, and
      in a corner out of the path of marauding tribes. Not too easy to find, its
      folk are peaceable, and I can see it again as I saw it on my first visit
      when, from the height of the precipice behind, I could make out the thin
      spires of smoke rising on the evening air and just perceive the brown
      herds of cattle drifting slowly homewards to the protecting kraals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tribe is a branch of the Bonde, iron workers and a settled folk. How
      they came to be there, so far north and west of the main stock of their
      people, I do not know, but of course one comes across that kind of thing
      fairly commonly and the explanation is nearly always the same. Fear of
      some kind drove out a family who wandered, like Abram from Charron, until
      they found a promised land. These folk knew that they came from the south
      and east a long long time ago; more they neither knew nor cared to know.
      They were not many in number, and although Arab <i>safaris</i> had passed
      by, they were not enough to tempt a permanent trader to cross the barren
      lands north and south, or dare the mountain way from Mweru. The chief&rsquo;s
      oldest councillor spoke to me of a slave-raid that had been defeated when
      he was a young man, but since then they had dwelt in peace. No European
      had been there within living memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such was, and may be still, the town of Mtakatifuni, as I shall call it.
      Do you know Ki-Swahili?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the name will do, and not spoil my tale. Let me but tell you how I
      came to be there and I will make haste about it. I was exploring. Ah, but
      once in all the years have I been able to explore! Usually we missionaries
      hurry from place to place on an unending round till the circle is as big
      as we can possibly manage. Then a new centre must be made, and it was
      because my Order had determined on a new centre that my opportunity came.
      The Vicar Apostolic was doubtful as to the direction in which we should
      expand. He sent me, therefore, west beyond Mweru to see what could be
      seen, and another farther south on the same errand. The folk were few
      about Mweru, but I heard a rumour of Mtakatifuni, much exaggerated, and
      set out to find it. Foolishly I went west until supplies were so low that
      it would have been fatal to turn back over the bare mountains by which we
      had come, and our only hope lay in pushing on. And so I reached my hidden
      town, stayed a while, and returned another way, to find that the other
      explorer had a report to make of more peopled and easier lands which found
      greater favour with his lordship. And rightly. When labourers are so few
      and the field is so big, it is necessary to settle where the work offers
      most prospect of large returns. So was I permitted to see, but not to
      enter in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leant forward to knock out his pipe, blew down it, refused more
      tobacco, and re-settled himself. &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said philosophically, &ldquo;le
      Bon Dieu knows best. I do not believe He has forgotten Mtakatifuni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was I? Oh yes, I remember. We saw the place then, in the evening,
      and next morning journeyed early towards it. You must understand that we
      were spent. I cannot recall better water than that at the source of that
      little river, and the roasted mealies they gave us, and sour milk, how
      good it all was! The chief had sent word that we were to be fed and given
      an empty house, and after I had eaten I went to see and thank him. I put
      on my cassock and with it my beads about my waist, and I carried my
      breviary in my hand, for I thought he might keep me waiting in the native
      fashion and that I could say my office in the meantime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he received me at once. The ground rose a little and was built up too
      before his group of huts, terraced roughly and faced with stone, with
      steps at one end. A big block of stone stood near the edge of it, so that
      standing behind one looked east over the town to the mountains, and it was
      there, after a little, that I offered the Holy Sacrifice each remaining
      day of my stay. There was little linen in the place, and he stood to greet
      me at the top of the steps, clad in prepared skins, a youngish man and a
      fine figure of a savage king. He gave me later the twisted iron spear of
      state that he carried that day. It hangs in our church of the Holy Cross
      now, behind the altar of the Sacred Heart. Surely the Good God will not
      forget Mtakatifuni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he greeted me courteously, with reserve, but with a suggestion of
      curious eagerness. I marked it at once. Not, however, till the usual
      questions as to my journeys and so on were over, did I get a clue to the
      cause of it. But then, when we were seated on stools by the great stone I
      have mentioned, big clay beakers of thin, delicious light beer beside us,
      he put a question. &lsquo;Why have you been so long a time coming, my father?&rsquo; 
      he asked. &lsquo;A little later and you would have been too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was slightly puzzled, but I supposed he referred to the length of my
      journey. &lsquo;The way was long and rough, chief,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But why were you so long in setting out?&rsquo; he persisted. &lsquo;Mwezi has been
      expecting you for many years.&rsquo; He turned to an old councillor. &lsquo;How many
      years has Mwezi been expecting the father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Since the days of the Great One, the father of the King,&rsquo; said the old
      man. &lsquo;Mwezi came first among us when I was a boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now most of this was Greek to me, but the speaker was fifty if he was a
      day, whatever allowance was to be made for the early ageing of Africans,
      and you may imagine that I understood enough to be surprised. &lsquo;How could
      that be, chief?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;When this old man was a boy, I had not crossed
      the black water to come to this land, and possibly I had not been born.
      Truly of this Mwezi I knew nothing, but how could he expect me whom even
      my mother had not seen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chief looked worried, and stared at me for awhile in silence. Then he
      nodded thoughtfully. &lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The father is doubtless wise
      and has seen years, but his beard is not white and the thing is strange.
      Nevertheless he wears the black robe and the dried beans, and he carries
      the book in his hand, even as Mwezi has said. Still, I have sent for
      Mwezi, and doubtless he will explain the matter. See, he comes; slowly,
      for he is very old. Does the father not remember him at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pointed down the path that led up to us from the town, into which had
      come a small crowd of natives who were eagerly following three or four
      figures, jostling each other to get a better view. It soon became plain
      that a young man led the way, and that after him came three of whom I
      guessed the central person to be Mwezi. I think he was the oldest native I
      have ever seen, bent, shrivelled, and stiff-jointed, but with keen dark
      eyes which, a little later, fixed themselves inquiringly on my face and
      then clouded with acute disappointment. On either side his sons helped him
      with a hand beneath his arm-pits, and he himself walked by means of a
      great stick. The crowd of hangers-on stopped respectfully below, but these
      four climbed up to the dais. A stool was brought for the old man, but at
      first he would not sit. He stood there, staring at me and shaking his
      head. &lsquo;It is not he,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it is not he. Yet he is like, very like.
      But it is not he.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was still perplexed at all this, but by this time a little amused.
      Nevertheless I hid that, for the old fellow was so plainly disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, father,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I am very sorry, but will you not explain?
      Perhaps it is a brother of mine whom you have seen. Seat yourself and tell
      me about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not seem at once to comprehend, but when his sons had persuaded
      him to sit, he made a peremptory motion with his stick towards the old
      councillor who had spoken before. This individual glanced at the chief for
      permission, and having received it, told me this story at considerable
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that, very many years before, in the time of the late king, the
      village had been one day thrown into a state of great excitement by the
      advent of a stranger. This had been Mwezi, at the time a man of middle
      age. He had come from the south and west&mdash;from Central Africa, that
      is&mdash;and he had said that he was seeking a white man whom it had been
      shown him he should find in that village. Pressed for details, he
      announced that he had come from a town far away by a wide river where
      there were great falls over whose rocks the water thundered night and day
      in a perpetual cloud of spray. One night he had awakened in his hut, and
      had seen a white man standing before him dressed in a black robe, a string
      of beads, and carrying a book. Behind the white man he could see, as it
      were, the vision of a town, a river, a precipice&mdash;in short, what he
      now saw to have been Mtakatifuni. The figure had beckoned him solemnly,
      and he had sat up in his bed in fear. It had beckoned again, and had then
      pointed north and east, and at that the vision had died away before the
      startled sleeper&rsquo;s eyes. But Mwezi understood. In his mind there had been
      no question as to what he must do. In the dawn he had risen, said good-bye
      to his wife and family, and set out. For two years he had journeyed,
      wandering from place to place, scarcely knowing whither he went save that
      it was always north and east. The very wild beasts had respected him, and
      men, seeing the vision in his eyes, had withheld their hands from him. At
      length, then, he had reached Mtakatifuni. There, as always, he had
      inquired for his white man, and, hearing that no white man had ever been
      there but convinced that it was the place of his dream, he sat down to
      wait. He had grown old waiting; had married, and had begotten sons and
      daughters. Now he was too old to move; all but too old to live; but still
      he waited. Still he believed he would see his white man again before he
      died; indeed, he could not die until he had seen. My coming had seemed to
      the whole place the fulfilment of his vision, but I was not the man. Mwezi
      was sure of that and no one doubted him. And maybe, now, added the
      councillor, he would never see him. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I had been long enough in Africa to set little store by native dreams
      as a rule. The affair, then, seemed to me pathetic rather than
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eyes kept straying to the old fellow while the story was being told
      me, and I marvelled to think of the simplicity of his faith, the weariness
      of his journey into the unknown, and the tenacity with which he had clung
      to his obsession. That this man should have given his whole life to such a
      quest, and should now be so bitterly disappointed when a remote chance had
      brought it nearer realisation than had been in the least degree likely,
      was indeed certainly cruel. I therefore turned to him to make what amends
      I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But, old Mwezi,&rsquo; I said as kindly as possible, &lsquo;doubtless you are
      mistaken. It was but once that you saw the figure in your dream, and that
      years ago. You dreamt of a white man dressed as I. Well, I belong to a
      regiment of white men who dress alike, and for many lives it has been the
      custom of that regiment to dress so. Doubtless as a boy you had seen one
      of my brethren, or perchance a picture of one, and your spirit saw him
      again in a dream. If I am right, and your home is on that great river
      which we white men call the Zambesi, then it is not unlikely that such a
      thing happened. Perhaps you have forgotten. Now in me you see him whom you
      seek.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old fellow&rsquo;s keen eyes flashed angrily. &lsquo;The white stranger mocks
      me,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protested. &lsquo;No, father, I do not mean to mock you. Why should I do so?
      But come now, can you describe the face of the man you saw?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I can, and easily. His beard was white and not as thine. Moreover, he
      was bald-headed, and beneath his right eye was there a little scar such as
      he had perhaps received in the hunt from some beast or the other. His face
      was long and thin, and his nose bigger. Am I a child that I should not
      know one man from another? Thou art not he.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was foolish of me, but I was surprised out of all caution. &lsquo;How could
      you see so much in the dark of your hut?&rsquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mwezi rose to his feet and made a pathetic effort to hold his head erect.
      With true native dignity, he ignored me and turned to the chief. &lsquo;With the
      leave of the chief, I go,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I am old and would rest in my place.
      Fare thee well, father of thy people. The Heavens guard thee. Be in
      peace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I realised that I had blundered, but at the moment there was nothing to
      do. We watched the procession move away again almost in silence, and I
      noticed curiously that the crowd were even more interested in Mwezi than
      in myself, a white stranger. When he was out of sight, I apologised to the
      chief, who, however, would not hear that I had done any wrong. He himself
      showed me back to the house set apart for us and invited me to feast with
      him in the evening. He gave me leave to speak to his people, and I
      remember that I was so dog-tired that I lay down at once and slept for the
      rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning, however, I remembered Mwezi, and told the chief that I
      would like to go and call on him. I determined to do what I could for the
      old fellow&rsquo;s peace of mind, and, with a guide and one of my own boys, we
      set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way led through the native huts and without them. It was downhill
      going, as the village, in African fashion, was built on the side of a rise
      which culminated in the chief&rsquo;s hut, while Mwezi lived, very close to the
      source of the river I have mentioned. We emerged through trees into a
      grassy open space of perhaps thirty paces wide, and I saw at once the old
      fellow sitting at the door of his hut beneath the shade of a wild vine
      which grew luxuriantly over the porch and roof. I was too much occupied in
      greeting him to take note at once of the building, but when we were
      seated, and he had been thawed out of his first coolness, I looked more
      closely at it. It interested me. It was long in shape, much longer than
      the usual native hut, and with three windows narrow and pointed, one of
      them now roughly blocked with sods. I examined the stones of the walls,
      getting up to do so. They struck me as being old and much more carefully
      laid than is usual in native work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Did you build this house yourself, old man?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;It is well made.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I did not build it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I found it here. When I came to
      Mtakatifuni, it was empty and had been empty for long. There was no roof
      to it in those days, and few came near the place. But that suited me. My
      mind was full of him whom I had seen, and my spirit told me that I should
      await him here. The father of the chief then gave it me, no councillor
      knowing aught about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And you planted this vine and cleared this space, perhaps?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I did not. I did but train the vine which had blocked the door, and cut
      down for the wood of the roof the young trees that had grown here. But
      some other had cleared the ground before me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Would you mind if I looked within, Mwezi?&rsquo; I questioned, for to tell you
      the truth my curiosity was thoroughly aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old fellow got up courteously. &lsquo;Enter, white man,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;My sons
      shall bring the stools and fetch us beer. I am old and poor, but you are
      welcome. You are at least of the people of him I saw, and shall I, in my
      sorrow, forbid you to come in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We entered. The place was divided into two by a sod partition, plainly
      recent in construction, and I looked disappointedly at what I could see.
      There were the usual scant furnishings of a native hut&mdash;a <i>kitanda</i>,
      some pots, a stool or two, a few spears in a corner. But when I passed
      round the partition, my interest increased tenfold. I even cried out in my
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw what I had not been able to see from the fact of my approach from
      the west of the clearing. The eastern end of the hut was not built
      squarely as the other, but roughly rounded in what elsewhere I should
      unhesitatingly have called an apse, and since on either side there were
      still visible a couple of those narrow pointed windows, while the floor
      space was practically empty, the suggestion of a chapel was complete. I
      ought, perhaps, to have guessed it before, but the thought burst on me
      suddenly. The situation, near the stream rather than up on the hill, the
      orientation, the unusual length, the vine, the clearing&mdash;everything
      pointed in the same direction. And then the old man&rsquo;s story. I was frankly
      amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned and saw him standing in the doorway, his hand on the mud wall
      for support, his eyes peering at me from his bowed head. If I had been
      momentarily suspicious of a knowledge hitherto kept from me, all fled at
      the sight of him. He was transparently honest and eager. &lsquo;What is it,
      white man?&rsquo; he quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mwezi,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;here is a strange thing and a wonder. You tell me that
      you saw in your vision a white man, and I know from what you say that he
      was a priest. You travelled far, and your spirit sent you here. Well, I do
      not doubt that this house of yours was once a place of worship, and I
      think it was built by white priests. Think now, have you heard of no such
      thing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He swayed a little as he stood, and did not answer at once. Then he
      slowly shook his head. &lsquo;I have heard nothing, nothing,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If it be
      so, none know of these things, white man. Art thou sure? Thou wouldst not
      mock me again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mwezi,&rsquo; I cried eagerly, &lsquo;I do not mock you. Why should I do any such
      thing? I cannot yet tell certainly, but this place is such as we build for
      prayers, and we may yet make sure. May I search more diligently?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do what thou wilt, my son,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and if my hands cannot, my spirit
      will help thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There and then I began a close scrutiny. I went outside, measured,
      tapped, sought, but I found nothing more. If there had ever been a stoup,
      a cross, a rude piscina, they had long since gone. But the more I
      searched, the more sure grew my conviction that the place had been a
      chapel. At last I sat down to rest, and while resting, I had an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mwezi,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;have you ever dug up the floor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shook his head. &lsquo;Why should I dig it up?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Would you allow me to do so?&rsquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked doubtful. &lsquo;But why?&rsquo; he asked again, suspiciously. &lsquo;And would
      you dig even now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laughed. &lsquo;Well, not at once,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;We must find a new house for you
      first. But if I am right, it may be that things are buried here, or that
      there are stones which will tell me a tale. See, the floor is higher now
      than it was. There was a step here at the door, and the mud has nearly
      covered it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is but the smearing,&rsquo; he said, half contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That roused me. Of course I know the native habit of cleaning a house by
      putting down a fresh layer of mud mixed with a little dung, which in time
      raises the floor considerably. But I was not to be put off by that. Below
      the smearing of the old man&rsquo;s time might be a layer of earth thrown in to
      hide something. I glanced round. &lsquo;May I borrow a spear?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He nodded, and I selected one from the corner with a long thin blade.
      Then I went into the inner room, and he came and stood again to watch me
      with his peering old eyes. Under his scrutiny, I began in the apse and
      thrust downward as far as I could. The blade sank to its hilt fairly
      easily, and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus I stabbed until I came to the string of the apse, and then, almost
      at once, I made a discovery. The point of the blade struck a stone. A foot
      to the left, it touched again, and a foot more. In a few minutes I was all
      but certain that a stone slab was buried there. You may imagine my
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mwezi called his sons and sent one for a native hoe. When he returned, we
      all gathered about the place while he slowly dug up the trampled mud. In a
      few minutes a stone slab was being exposed to view, and with my spear I
      got to work scraping off the earth while he dug free the other end.
      Suddenly, as I scraped, I made out a cross, and to cut the story short, we
      laid bare at length what had undoubtedly been an altar-stone. Every one of
      the five crosses were plainly visible, and left no room for question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We stopped out of breath, and I explained something of its use. At that
      Mwezi spoke suddenly, calling our attention to him. &lsquo;Lift it, lift it,&rsquo; he
      cried. &lsquo;Lift it at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man was a striking spectacle. His withered face was simply alive
      with emotion. He was kneeling on hands and knees, and his thin fingers
      worked at the edge of the slab. Something in his voice compelled us, and
      we got at once to work. After all it was an easy task, for it was soon
      apparent that the stone was fitted into brick, with which the whole place
      was paved, and with spade and spear we levered it up a little. Then two of
      Mwezi&rsquo;s sons got their fingers under it, and without any great effort
      raised it completely. They staggered aside with it and the rest of us
      peered within. For a second we looked, and then Mwezi gave a great cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My father, my father! Lo, I have come to thee, as thou didst bid. These
      many years have I waited, for my spirit spoke true, bidding me rest above
      thee. Now will I pass on whither thou art passed, and as thou hadst
      understanding, so it shall befall. Lo, I come to thee, seeking peace!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His voice hesitated, and failed, and he fell forward very gently and
      slowly till his head rested on his hands on the edge of the tomb. None of
      us dared to move for a few seconds, for Mwezi&rsquo;s voice rang so truly and
      convincingly. Great awe fell on us all, for he had spoken as one who
      certainly saw. Then I stretched out my hand and touched him, but he had
      gone, as he said. And on his face was peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all there is to tell in a way. For inside the grave, if grave it
      were, there was nothing at all that it was given to our eyes to see&mdash;not
      a bone, not a shred of a habit, nor book nor beads. If ever a body or
      treasures of any sort had been there, the receptacle had been rifled long
      before, and entirely forgotten. So there is literally no more to tell. Of
      course the affair made great excitement. The chief and all his people came
      to see, and came once again the day after when I lowered Mwezi into the
      grave and replaced the altar stone. After that the door and the windows
      were blocked up at my request, against the day of the coming of the Faith
      once more to Mtaka-tifuni. For that, the space about the sanctuary is to
      be kept clear of undergrowth, by order of the chief. For that old Mwezi
      waits beneath the altar, and maybe he whom he saw waits also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner bugle had sounded a few moments before Père Etienne had
      finished, and now we rose to go. We stood a second, and I gazed over the
      side at the star-shine on the water, for the night was fine. When I looked
      up, Père Etienne was staring out into the darkness, a far-away look on his
      face, but he must have felt my eyes on him, for he turned quickly and
      smiled. Possibly he read a question I rather wanted to ask, but did not
      dare. Anyway, he smiled, as I say, and shook his head. &ldquo;I have lived too
      long in Africa to have theories, my friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but to me the
      memory of Mwezi and his chapel is a very precious thing. We are all of us
      souls on pilgrimage, and we rarely understand why or how, or remember that
      we have a Guide. But I like to think in the end, the Good God willing, we
      shall find a hidden sanctuary and that we have been led to a place
      prepared.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
